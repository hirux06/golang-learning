# 📘 Golang Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Golang Learning** repository! This repo contains very **basic, beginner-friendly Go programs**, structured clearly by topic. I created this for my own learning journey — and hopefully, it helps others starting with Go too. 😊

**Note:** This was created by me when I was studying golang. So, sometimes it might have incomplete codes. Feel free to contribute by following the below guide 👇

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Each folder corresponds to a fundamental Golang concept.
- Every folder has a single `main.go` file with clean, minimal code.
- Contributions are warmly welcome! See below. 👇

## 📌 Contribution Guide

Want to help improve this repo? Here's how you can contribute:

- ✅ Add **output examples** for existing programs (maybe some corner cases and parameters too can be considered).
- ✅ Add **brief comment explanations** inside `main.go` files.
- ✅ **Suggest improvements** or new beginner topics.
- ✅ Keep code beginner-friendly!

**Note:** If you add new codes/topics make sure to include **brief comment explanations** inside `main.go` files for future references.
